      <p><strong>The raccoon</strong> is a medium-sized mammal native to <em>North America</em>. Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which insulates it against cold weather. Two of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely
        dexterous front paws and its facial mask, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.</p>
